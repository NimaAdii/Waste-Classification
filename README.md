The development of a Smart Waste Management System incorporating an Image Classification unit running on a Raspberry Pi 4 B single-board computer. The system utilizes a conveyor belt with actuators, sensors, and an Arduino microcontroller board to transfer waste to the correct bin. Additionally, a compressing and sealing unit, controlled by the same Arduino microcontroller board, is connected to the Raspberry Pi via a serial connection. This unit is capable for compressing waste and sealing the corresponding waste collection bag.
